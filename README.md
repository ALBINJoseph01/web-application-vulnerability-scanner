This is a Python-based web vulnerability scanner designed to identify common web application vulnerabilities, including XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, and more. The scanner uses the requests library for making HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML forms.
Features

   XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Detection: Scans for potential XSS vulnerabilities using predefined payloads.
  
  SQL Injection Detection: Identifies potential SQL injection vulnerabilities using typical SQLi payloads.
  
  CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Detection: Checks for CSRF vulnerabilities by analyzing the response.
  
  Cookie Security Check: Verifies that cookies are set with secure and HttpOnly flags.
  
  Open Redirect Detection: Tests for open redirects which could be exploited for phishing attacks.
  
  Insecure Headers Check: Ensures that security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and X-Content-Type-Options are present.

Installation

  Clone the Repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ALBINJoseph01/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
    
    cd web-vulnerability-scanner
    

Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Scanner:

You can run the scanner using the following command:

    python scanner.py scan <url> --method GET --output_format text

Usage
Basic Scan

To perform a basic scan on a URL, you can use:

    python scanner.py scan <url>

Scan with Custom Payloads

You can provide a file with custom payloads:

    python scanner.py scan <url> --payload_file payloads.txt

Specify HTTP Method

You can choose whether to use GET or POST requests:

    python scanner.py scan <url> --method POST

Test for XSS in Specific Text Boxes

Specify which text box names to target for XSS:

    python scanner.py scan <url> --text_box_names "username,password"

Output Formats

You can output the results in text or JSON format:

    python scanner.py scan <url> --output_format json

Example Payload File

The payload file should have a format like this:


    sqli:' OR '1'='1',"' OR '1'='1' --"
    xss:<script>alert('XSS')</script>,"'><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"
    csrf:<input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="fake_token">
    open_redirect:/redirect?url=http://evil.com

Each line represents a different category of attack, with payloads separated by commas.
